#  Environmental Data Monitoring

AI system that can collect, process, and analyze various types of environmental data, including air quality, water pollution, deforestation rates, and climate patterns. The system should provide insights and visualizations to understand the current state of the environment.



## Environmental Setup

Install Python: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install Required Packages: The code uses several external packages. You can install them using pip, the package installer for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
 pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost scikit-learn pillow

```


## Running the  code


Clone the repository or download the code folder to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.
```bash
   python app.py
```
The script will prompt you to enter your choice for the dataset (1 for Water Quality, 2 for Air Quality). Enter the appropriate number and press Enter.

Follow the Instructions: The code prompts for user input to provide file paths and make choices. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal/command prompt to provide the necessary inputs.

For the Deforestation dataset, you will be asked to enter file paths for data.csv, Counties.csv, and states.csv.

For the Water Quality dataset, the code will load the dataset
without requiring any additional file paths.

For the Air Quality dataset, you will be asked to enter the file path for the dataset file.

View the Results: 
The code will generate outputs, such as data summaries, visualizations, and predictions, depending on the dataset and analysis performed. The results will be displayed in the terminal/command prompt and/or saved as files.
## Run Locally
